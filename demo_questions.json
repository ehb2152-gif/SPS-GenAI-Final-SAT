        "question": "Please select a topic area and a specific algebra variable, and create a math question that is suitable for the SAT.\n\nTopic Area: Algebra\nVariable: x\n\nQuestion: The following equation is true for all real values of x:\n2x + 5 = 3x - 2\n\nA) 2x - 5 = 3x + 2\nB) 3x - 2 = 2x + 5\nC) 2x - 3 = 3x + 5\nD) x = 7\n\nWhat is the correct answer?",
        "solution": "Explanation: The correct answer is B. To solve this problem, subtract 2x from both sides of the equation and simplify: 2x - 2x + 5 = 3x - 2x - 2x + 2, which simplifies to 5 = x + 2. Subtract 2 from both sides of this equation: 5 - 2 = x + 2 - 2, which simplifies to 3 = x. Therefore, the correct answer is B.Choice A is incorrect. The correct answer is B. To solve this problem, subtract 2x from both sides of the equation and simplify: 2",

        "solution": "answer: B) Perceptive\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B) Perceptive. This word is most closely related to the concept of \"perspicacious\" because both words describe the ability to notice and understand details.
