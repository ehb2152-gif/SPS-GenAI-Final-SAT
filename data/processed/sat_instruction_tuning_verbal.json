First, the speaker describes\nobserving a \u201cmost beautiful\u201d sight: a tree (\u201cblack cypress\u201d) standing out from the golden sky behind it, looking like a person\u2019s finger\n\u201cpointing upwards\u201d and appearing \u201csensitive\u201d and \u201cexquisite.\u201d Then the speaker wonders about the image\u2019s meaning, asking why\nthe finger is black and why it\u2019s pointing upward. Thus, the text moves from the speaker\u2019s description of a distinctive sight in nature\nto her pondering about what meaning to attribute to that sight.\nChoice A is incorrect because the speaker assesses a natural sight\u2014a \u201cblack cypress\u201d tree standing \u201cagainst a gold, gold sky\u201d like\na pointed finger\u2014but doesn\u2019t question the accuracy of her own assessment. Although she wonders why the finger, which is really a\ntree, is black and why it\u2019s pointing, the speaker doesn\u2019t suggest that her belief that the tree resembles a finger is wrong. Choice C is\nincorrect. Although the speaker describes seeing a \u201cblack cypress\u201d tree standing \u201cagainst a gold, gold sky\u201d like a pointed finger,\nshe wonders about that natural image (asking why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it\u2019s pointing) and doesn\u2019t give\nany indication that any people are present in the scene. Choice D is incorrect. Although the speaker examines and wonders about\none thing in her surroundings\u2014a \u201cblack cypress\u201d tree standing \u201cagainst a gold, gold sky\u201d like a pointed finger\u2014she doesn\u2019t address\nher own emotional state or consider how it\u2019s affected by her surroundings."}

Thus, \"mediated by\" accurately captures this relationship where noneconomic factors\ninfluence what might otherwise be purely economic decisions.\nChoice A is incorrect because \"transposed with\" would suggest that economic and noneconomic factors are being switched or\ninterchanged when making residential mobility decisions, which wouldn\u2019t make logical sense in this context. The text indicates\nthat these factors coexist and jointly influence such decisions. Choice C is incorrect. The phrase \"decoupled from\" means\nseparated or disconnected from, which would suggest that economic factors are completely separate from noneconomic factors.\nThis would contradict the text\u2019s main point that residential mobility decisions involve multiple factors being considered\nsimultaneously rather than in isolation. Choice D is incorrect because \"antecedent to,\" which means something prior or earlier,\nwould indicate that noneconomic factors come before economic ones in time or sequence. The text doesn\u2019t establish this\nchronological relationship. Instead, the text indicates that economic factors (household spending power) and noneconomic\nfactors (access to social networks) simultaneously influence residential mobility decisions."}

The narrator of the\ntext says that when Dorian sees his portrait, \u201chis cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure\u201d and \u201ca look of joy came into his\neyes.\u201d The narrator goes on to say that Dorian looked at the portrait \u201cin wonder\u201d and presents him as being so entranced by the\nportrait that he doesn\u2019t notice what Hallward is saying to him. All these details support the description of Dorian as being delighted\nby what he sees in the portrait.\nChoice A is incorrect because Dorian isn\u2019t depicted as interested in Hallward\u2019s opinion of the portrait but rather as so enraptured by\nthe painting that he\u2019s hardly even aware of Hallward. Choice C is incorrect because the portrait of Dorian is the only painting that is\nmentioned in the text, so there\u2019s no evidence that Dorian prefers portraits to other types of paintings. Although Dorian is depicted\nas delighted with this particular portrait, there\u2019s no way of knowing from the text whether he likes portraits better than other kinds\nof paintings. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Dorian is uncertain about Hallward\u2019s talent. Instead,\nthe text is focused on Dorian\u2019s delight with the portrait."}

Some historians suggest that Maya mathematicians inherited it from the Olmec civilization, which flourished in the region 2,400\u20133,600 years ago. According to the text, what do some historians suggest about Maya civilization?","output":"The correct answer is A. Explanation: Choice A is the best answer because it presents information about Maya civilization that is supported by the text. The text states\nthat the writing system used in the Maya kingdoms had a symbol for the number zero. It goes on to say that at the time of the zero\nsymbol\u2019s earliest example, more than 2,000 years ago, almost no other writing systems in the world featured such a symbol. The\ntext also points out that some historians suggest that Maya mathematicians inherited the use of zero from the Olmec civilization,\nwhich existed in the same area as the Maya civilization at an earlier date. Thus, according to the text, some historians suggest that\nthe Maya civilization acquired the use of zero from the Olmec civilization.\nChoice B is incorrect because although the text mentions present-day historians and Maya mathematicians, it does not say\nanything about how much the Maya civilization respected its historians and mathematicians. Choice C is incorrect because the\ntext does not indicate that the Maya civilization treated its use of the zero symbol, or any other intellectual achievements, as\nsecrets to be kept from other civilizations. Choice D is incorrect because although the text mentions historians who suggest that\nthe writing system of the Maya civilization inherited some features from the earlier Olmec civilization, the text does not describe\nany attempts of Maya civilization to introduce its writing system to other civilizations."}

However, there is no evidence of significant spikes in carbon dioxide levels coinciding with relevant periods in sauropod evolution, such as when the first large sauropods appeared, when several sauropod lineages underwent further evolution toward gigantism, or when sauropods reached their maximum known sizes, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text?","output":"The correct answer is B. Explanation: Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text\u2019s discussion of the\nrelationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide and sauropod body size. The text establishes that sauropods evolved to reach\nenormous sizes, and it notes that some scientists have asserted that the cause of this phenomenon was increased plant\nproduction that resulted from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. The text goes on to state, however, that atmospheric carbon\ndioxide levels didn\u2019t increase around the time of important periods in sauropods\u2019 evolution of larger body sizes. If significant\nperiods of sauropod evolution toward larger sizes occurred without increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, that suggests\nthat the evolution of larger sizes didn\u2019t depend on increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t describe any fluctuations in atmospheric carbon dioxide, so there\u2019s no evidence in\nthe text to support the conclusion that such fluctuations had different effects on different sauropod lineages. All that the text says\nabout atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is that there weren\u2019t increases at particular points that correspond with key moments in\nsauropod evolution. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that there weren\u2019t significant increases in atmospheric carbon\ndioxide around the time of important periods in sauropods\u2019 evolution toward larger body sizes, not that atmospheric carbon\ndioxide was higher when the largest sauropods lived than when sauropods first appeared.

Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the stability of\naerospace equipment may be better improved by composites containing nitrogen-treated SiC fiber than by composites containing\nthe two polymer-derived SiC fibers, not the other way around.

Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn\u2019t have used ink with titanium dioxide,\nit follows that the Vinland Map couldn\u2019t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers.\nChoice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn\u2019t available until the early 1900s\ndoesn\u2019t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn\u2019t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding\nsuggests that the map couldn\u2019t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless\nhad knowledge\u2014and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers\u2014of\nthe eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s. Choice C is incorrect because there\u2019s nothing in the text\nthat suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay,\nZyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds.\nInstead, the text indicates that titanium dioxide wasn\u2019t used in ink before the early 1900s. This knowledge led the team to conclude\nthat the map, which was drawn with ink containing titanium dioxide, couldn\u2019t have been created in the mid-1400s. Choice D is\nincorrect because although the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for the creation of the\nink that was used to draw the Vinland Map, the text does say that titanium dioxide was introduced in ink manufacturing in the early\n1900s. This fact provides enough information to determine that the ink that was used to draw the map was created no earlier than\nthe early 1900s. This finding, in turn, led the team to conclude that the Vinland Map couldn\u2019t have been drawn in the mid-1400s."}
