Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.

Choices $\\mathrm{B}$ and $D$ are incorrect and may be the result of errors made when solving the equation $16+4 x=10+14$ for $x$. For example, choice D could be the result of subtracting 16 from the left side of the equation and adding 16 to the right side of the equation $16+4 x=10+14$, giving $4 x=40$ and $8 x=80$.",

      " To estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job, we need to ensure that our sample is representative of the entire employee population. Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store\n- This method may not be representative because the sample is drawn from only one store, which might not be typical of the entire company.\n\nB: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected\n- This method is more likely to be representative because it includes employees from multiple stores. However, it might still be biased if the selection within each store is not random or if the stores themselves are not representative.\n\nC: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees\n- This method is likely to be biased because it focuses on a specific subset of employees based on their salary, which may not be representative of the entire employee population.\n\nD: Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses\n- This method is also likely to be biased because it relies on self-selection, where only those who choose to respond might be surveyed. This can lead to non-response bias.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate method would be to select a random sample of employees from across all stores. This ensures that the sample is more likely to be representative of the entire employee population. Therefore, the best option is:\n\nB: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected\n\nHowever, to ensure the best representation, a more systematic random sampling approach across all stores would be ideal. If this is not feasible, option B is the most practical given the constraints.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$."

Of the given choices, only $(2,-1)$ satisfies these conditions because $-1<2-1$ $=1$.Alternate approach: Substituting $(2,-1)$ into the first inequality gives $-1 \\leq 3(2)+1$, or $-1 \\leq 7$, which is a true statement. Substituting $(2,-1)$ into the second inequality gives $2-(-1)>1$, or 3 $>1$, which is a true statement. Therefore, since $(2,-1)$ satisfies both inequalities, it is a solution to the system.Choice $A$ is incorrect because substituting -2 for $x$ and -1 for $y$ in the first inequality gives $-1 \\leq$ $3(-2)+1$, or $-1 \\leq-5$, which is false.

Choice $C$ is incorrect because substituting 1 for $x$ and 5 for $y$ in the first inequality gives $5 \\leq 3(1)+1$, or $5 \\leq 4$, which is false.",

The linear function that represents the relationship will be in the form $r(p)$ $=a p+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants and $r(p)$ is the monthly rental price, in dollars, of a property that was purchased with $p$ thousands of dollars. According to the table, $(70,515)$ and $(450,3,365)$ are ordered pairs that should satisfy the function, which leads to the system of equations below.$$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}70 a+b=515 \\\\450 a+b=3,365\\end{array}\\right.$$Subtracting side by side the first equation from the second eliminates $b$ and gives $380 a=2,850$; solving for $a$ gives $a=\\frac{2,850}{380}=7.5$.

So the polynomial $P(x)$ can be rewritten as $P(x)=(x+1) q(x)+R$, where $q(x)$ is a polynomial of second degree and $R$ is a constant.

Squaring both sides of $\\sqrt{2 x+6}=x-1$ yields $2 x+6=x^{2}-2 x+1$. This equation can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in standard form: $x^{2}-4 x-5=0$. One way to solve this quadratic equation is to factor the expression $x^{2}-4 x-5$ by identifying two numbers with a sum of -4 and a product of -5 . These numbers are -5 and 1 . So the quadratic equation can be factored as $(x-5)(x+1)=0$. It follows that 5 and -1 are the solutions to the quadratic equation. However, the solutions must be verified by checking whether 5 and -1 satisfy the original equation, $\\sqrt{2 x+6}+4=x+3$.

It is given that the total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed as a system of two equations, $x+y=60$ and $2 x+4 y=202$. The first equation can be rewritten as $y=-x+60$. Substituting $-x+60$ for $y$ in the equation $2 x+4 y=202$ yields $2 x+4(-x+60)=202$. Distributing and combining like terms gives $-2 x+240=202$. Subtracting 240 from both sides of $-2 x+240=202$ and then dividing both sides by -2 gives $x=19$.
