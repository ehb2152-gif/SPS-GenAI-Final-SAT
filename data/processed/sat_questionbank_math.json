It is given that\nthe total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed as a\nsystem of two equations, and . The first equation can be rewritten as . Substituting\nfor y in the equation yields . Distributing and combining like terms gives\n. Subtracting 240 from both sides of and then dividing both sides by gives .\nTherefore, the number of 2-person tents is 19.\nAlternate approach: If each of the 60 tents held 4 people, the total number of people that could be accommodated in tents would\nbe 240. However, the actual number of people who slept in tents was 202. The difference of 38 accounts for the 2-person tents.\nSince each of these tents holds 2 people fewer than a 4-person tent, gives the number of 2-person tents.\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice may result from assuming exactly half of the tents hold 2 people. If that were true, then the total\nnumber of people who slept in tents would be ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was\n202, not 180. Choice B is incorrect. If 20 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 40 tents would be 4-person tents.

If an additional eruption with bursts is added to this data set to create a new data set of eruptions, the median\nof the new data set will be between the and elements in the ordered set, which will also be . Therefore, the median\nnumber of bursts for the new data set will be the same as the median number of bursts for the original data set. The mean number\nof bursts for the original data set is found by adding the values of all elements and dividing that sum by the number of\nelements, .

Account A starts with $500 and earns interest at 6% per year, so in the first year Account A earns (500)(0.06) =\n$30, which is greater than the $25 that Account B earns that year. Compounding interest can be modeled by an increasing\nexponential function, so each year Account A will earn more money than it did the previous year.
